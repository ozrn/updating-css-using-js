# JS30 #3:updating-css-using-js
This project is to update CSS variables like spacing, blur and base color by using JavaScript.<br><br>
* spacing: when spacing size is changed, the space between the image and it's frame increases or decreases.<br><br>
* blur: it creates blurry effect using the CSS filter property and that means you can change how much you want it to be blurred by updating the range.<br><br>
* base color: when that color is changed, it updates everywhere it's referenced on the actual page.
